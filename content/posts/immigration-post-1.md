This is the first of what I believe will be several posts reviewing chapters from the book I am currently reading, *Good Economics for Hard times* by Banerjee and Duflo (2019 Nobel laureates). The pair of economists explore hot-button issues such as immigration, trade, and climate change, presenting the economic literature's consensus on the topic and pointing out flaws in the layman's view (as well as flaws in the expert opinion). I will summarize their arguments, explore the data on my own, and respond to Banerjee and Duflo's exposition. This post will review Banerjee and Duflo's chapter on immigration, summarizing the main takeaways and then responding. Special attention will be paid to the recent surge in immigration in the United States. Through this evaluation, we will see if Banerjee and Duflo's arguments from 2019 hold true for our situation.

### In Banerjee and Duflo's Words
Banerjee and Duflo begin their discussion by explaining its relevance. Suprisingly, the authors note that immigration is not an especially pertinent topic due to some large increase in immigration but because of "recent alarmism" in the public that has been stoked by politicians worldwide. The percentage of international migrants globally in 2017 was roughly the same as it was in 1960 or 1990. However, the authors reference several surveys which show how citizens of a nation repeatedly overestimate the level of immigration their country is experiencing. Banerjee and Duflo argue the fears behind these overestimates and the arguments made by isolationist politicians are not supported by data nor economic theory. I will list my main takeaways from the chapter and briefly summarize them. 

1. **Not many migrate**
Banerjee and Duflo point out that given the economic benefits that moving location can generate, we would expect to see a lot more folks packing up and heading to a new location. Supporting this point, the authors note that the countries with the most emmigrants, such as Iraq, Syria, Guatemala, and even Yemen, are "far from being the poorest in the world." Accounting for differences in the cost of living, per capita income in Iraq is roughly twenty times that in Liberia and ten times as high as in Mozambique or Sierra Leone. The surge in immigration the United States has experienced (a phenomenon we explore later) has largely come from migrants crossing the US-Mexico border. Banerjee and Duflo (writing back in 2019) point out that Mexico is an upper-middle-income country with a "much praised and widely imitated welfare system." Even within a country, workers will generally not migrate for improved economic opportunities. Through review of several studies, the authors conclude that immigrants and migrants can make real gains in their living standards by moving. However, they are reluctant to do so. After discussing the benefits accrued by displaced Icelanders who lost their homes in a volcanic eruoption and by relocated Finlanders following WWII, Banerjee and Duflo write "That is takes a disaster scenario or a war to motivate people to gravitate to a location with the highest wages shows economic incentives on their own are often not sufficient to get people to move." A study of rural workers in Bangladesh found that even when provided information about better job opportunities available in the cities during the "lean season" where rural work is harder to secure, workers still did not migrate. Even when offered a stipend to cover travel and a few days' expenses, conditional on the worker migrating, only 22 percent of households sent a worker into the city. Those workers earned substantially more than they would have if they had remained, sending back much-needed cash to their families who were able to consume 50 percent more calories, reaching a "comfortable level of food nutrition." However, during the next lean season, only about half of the migrants who recieved financial support migrated back to the city for better employment. Despite knowing the benefits well out-weighed the costs, people refused to move.

Taking the dysmal science at its face value, these relevations would shock an economist. Banerjee and Duflo sumarize: "Given the size of the economic rewards, there are many fewer migrants than we would expect." Thankfully, the discipline has developed its model of human behavior beyond the rigid *homo economicus* -- a utility-maximizing robot that performs nearly-instantaneous analysis of costs and benefits. As the authors explain in their chapter, human psychology is the missing piece to this puzzle. Summarizing the arguments briefly: humans are loss-adverse, connection-dependent, and poor estimators of risk. These factors make migration unappealing to all besides the well-off, exceedingly desperate, or exceedingly determined. 

2. **Effect on native wages and unemployment**
To summarize the findings from the economic literature, Banerjee and Duflo quote the 2017 report on the impact of immigration from the US National Academy of Sciences, which gathers academic experts together to reach a consensus on various topics. The panel for the immigration study featured a range of opinions but was able to reach this conclusion: "Empirical research in recent decades suggests that findings remain by and large consistent with those in The new Americans National Research Council (1997) in that, when measured over a period of more than 10 years, the impact of immigration on the wages of natives overall is very small." This conclusion is not a slam-dunk for immigration advocates, but considering that it is the product of a varied group of economists attempting to reach a widely-accepted truth, it offers sizeable support for open immigration. Banerjee and Duflo explore several notable studies on the impact of immigration on wages, studies carefully designed to isolate immigration as a fully indepdent variable from wages (rather than a coincidental side-effect of wages rising in a particular location). Exploiting natural experiments created by random developments that unexpectedly increased immigration in certain cities/regions, these studies broadly find no negative impact of low-skilled immigration on native wages. Some studies found positive effects on native wages. A historical analysis of the European migration to the United States in the early 20th century found that European migrants "increased overall employment in the native population, made it more likely natives would become foremen or managers, and increased industrial production." In modern times, a study of immigration in Denmark in the late 1990s found that the low-skilled native Danish workers were able to change occupation and assume more complex roles that required more technical and communicative skill. 

The authors explain the economic theory that underlies the empirical evidence. Anti-immigration arguments suggest that immigrants boost the labor supply, meaning there are more workers competing for fewer jobs, permitting employers to shop around for the lowest demanded wages. This is an overly simplified supply-demand model. Immigrants spend money, buying groceries, going to restauraunts, purchasing clothes. This spending increases the demand for labor, pushing the supply and demand for labor closer to balance. The second point Banerjee and Duflo make involves the mechanization of labor. A boost in the labor supply delays the adoption of automating technology by producers. When California kicked out Mexican immigrant farm workers (*braceros*) in 1964, rather than hire natives, farms invested in machinery and switched to less labor-intensive crops. Adoption of tomato-harvesting equipment in California went from 0 percent in 1964 to 100 percent in 1967. For comparison, Ohio, which had no *braceros*, experienced no change in its adoption of the technology during the same period. Banerjee and Duflo suggest low-skilled immigrant workers complement native workers by freeing them to pursue occupational upgrades (as seen in the studies earlier) or by permitting high-skill workers to enter the labor force as immigrant workers lower the price of certain services #####

Banerjee and Duflo briefly overview high-skilled immigrants and reach a different conclusion. The skilled-worker labor market differs from the low-skilled labor market. Employers in this labor market are offering more attractive jobs and have less of a need to raise wages to retain workers. Additionally, there is more concern for an employee's skill set, rather than their personality or reliability. These two factors eliminate the advantages native low-skilled workers posess in the labor market. Banerjee and Duflo cite a study that found that "for every skilled, qualified foreign nurse employed in a city, there are between one and two fewer native-born nurses."
